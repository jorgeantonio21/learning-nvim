# Drills for dap

## Setup (3 min)
1. Create 20 lines with varied words, punctuation, and blank lines.
2. Add two short paragraphs and one code-like block.
3. Keep unnamed register effects in mind while deleting.

## Control Drill (10 min)
1. Execute 'dap' 30 times, each on a different target shape.
2. Use counts where valid (for example `3dap`) for grouped deletions.
3. After every 5 actions, paste with `p` once to confirm what was removed.

## Edge Drill (10 min)
1. Perform deletions at line start, in middle words, and across boundaries.
2. Intentionally over-delete once, then recover with `u` and redo correctly.
3. Repeat the same deletion pattern with `.` where it applies.

## Mastery Drill (7 min)
1. Clean a messy block to a target format using only 'dap' and motions.
2. No arrow keys, no mouse, no Visual mode.
3. Track total edits and reduce by one-third on the second round.
