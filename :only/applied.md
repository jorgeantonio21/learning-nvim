# Applied Practice for :only

## Scenario
Use ':only' in a realistic editing workflow (code or prose), not isolated command spam.

## Task Set
1. Prepare a 30-60 line sample file with repeated patterns.
2. Perform a transformation where ':only' is central.
3. Combine with one supporting command (motion/register/search/window) only when needed.
4. Save and verify outcome with a quick diff or visual re-check.

## Reflection
- Where did ':only' save time?
- Where did it create friction?
- What exact mistake happened most often?
