# NVChad Notes for y{motion}

## Native First
Train the native Vim behavior of 'y{motion}' before using plugin shortcuts.

## Map Awareness
1. Check keymaps only after the base drill.
2. If NVChad remaps this key, keep one session per day purely native.

## Optional Enhancement
After finishing evaluation, repeat one applied task using NVChad tooling (Telescope, terminal, UI helpers) while preserving the same core command usage.
