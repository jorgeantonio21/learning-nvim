# I

## Goal
Master 'I' from beginner to expert in focused, repeatable drills.

## Concept

## Success Criteria
- You can explain when to choose 'I' over close alternatives.
- You can execute it correctly 10 times in a row.
- You can combine it with motion/register/search/window context where applicable.
