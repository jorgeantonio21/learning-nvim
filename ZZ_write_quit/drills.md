# Drills for ZZ

## Setup (3 min)
1. Open two files, modify both, and leave one unmodified buffer.
2. Note which buffers have unsaved changes.
3. Prepare to repeat session-exit scenarios safely.

## Scenario Drill (10 min)
1. Use 'ZZ' in 12 scenarios mixing saved and unsaved buffers.
2. Predict result before pressing Enter each time.
3. Verify whether Vim exits, blocks, or discards changes.

## Safety Drill (8 min)
1. Intentionally trigger a blocked exit once.
2. Recover correctly using write/save or force-quit flow.
3. Repeat until behavior is predictable without hesitation.

## Mastery Drill (6 min)
1. Run a full session lifecycle: edit, save selectively, and exit with 'ZZ'.
2. Zero accidental data loss allowed.
3. Record which scenario still feels risky and repeat it twice.
