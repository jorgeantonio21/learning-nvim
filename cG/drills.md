# Daily Exercises for cG

## Practice Buffer
```text
EX-01 status = "pending"
EX-02 timeout_ms = 1200
EX-03 path = "/tmp/cache"
EX-04 user(name, email, role)
EX-05 if (ready) { run_job(); }
EX-06 title: draft
EX-07 priority: low
EX-08 env=dev region=us
EX-09 retry_count=1
EX-10 message="hello world"
```
