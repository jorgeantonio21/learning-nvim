# Drills for :registers

## Setup (4 min)
1. Build text with headings, lists, and repeated phrases.
2. Add one paragraph you can copy from and one destination paragraph.
3. Clear mental model: unnamed, numbered, and named registers.

## Register Awareness Drill (10 min)
1. Use ':registers' 20 times with explicit intent about source/destination text.
2. After every 4 operations, inspect registers with `:reg`.
3. Confirm which register changed and why.

## Composition Drill (10 min)
1. Combine ':registers' with motions or marks to perform targeted transfers.
2. Include at least 5 operations that use a non-default register.
3. Reproduce one full sequence using `.` or macro replay if applicable.

## Mastery Drill (6 min)
1. Reformat a section by moving/copying text only with register-driven actions.
2. Goal: no accidental overwrite of your planned register.
3. Finish with a final `:reg` check and list one improvement.
