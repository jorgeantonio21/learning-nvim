# Drills for :argdo

## Setup (4 min)
1. Open 3 files with distinct content sections.
2. Create at least one split and one additional buffer/tab where relevant.
3. Keep a small checklist of target layout/state changes.

## Navigation Drill (10 min)
1. Use ':argdo' 20 times to move between files, buffers, or windows.
2. After each action, say what state changed (active buffer, window count, tab index).
3. Avoid fuzzy switching; be explicit and deterministic.

## Workflow Drill (10 min)
1. Execute a mini task: open, edit, switch, and return without losing context.
2. Include at least 5 transitions that rely on ':argdo'.
3. If you get lost, recover using list/status commands only.

## Mastery Drill (6 min)
1. Time a complete multi-file edit run anchored on ':argdo'.
2. Target: zero wrong-buffer edits and zero abandoned windows.
3. Repeat once and improve both speed and state accuracy.
