3. Turn on `:set hlsearch` for visibility.

## Match Quality Drill (10 min)
1. Run '?' for 25 searches with explicit expected match positions.
2. Use whole-word, partial-word, and symbol-containing patterns.
3. Confirm each jump before editing to prevent wrong-target edits.

## Navigation Drill (8 min)
1. Alternate '?' with `n` and `N` to traverse result sets.
2. Perform 10 edits where each edit is at the 3rd or later match.
3. Cancel highlighting once, then re-enable and continue.
