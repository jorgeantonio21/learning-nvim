# Drills for i

## Setup (3 min)
1. Create a scratch buffer with 12 short lines of plain text.
2. Keep line 1 as a title, lines 2-11 as content, line 12 empty.
3. Use only Normal mode motions to position before each repetition.

## Precision Drill (8 min)
1. Run 'i' 30 times on different cursor positions.
2. After each insertion, hit `<Esc>` once and confirm you are back in Normal mode.
3. Undo with `u`, repeat at a new location, and keep rhythm steady.

## Context Drill (10 min)
1. Edit a paragraph so every sentence gains one extra qualifier using 'i'.
2. Use counts where valid (for example `3i`) and compare results.
3. Recover from two intentional mistakes using `u` and `Ctrl-r`.

## Mastery Drill (7 min)
1. Do 3 rounds editing the same text.
2. Round target: finish with zero mode mistakes and zero cursor-key usage.
3. Record total time and error count; beat your first round by at least 20%.
