# Drills for :args

## Warm-up (Beginner, 5 min)
1. Run ':args' 20 times on simple text.
2. Keep edits small and intentional.
3. Exit/return to normal mode cleanly after each repetition.

## Constraint Drill (Intermediate, 10 min)
1. Solve a short editing task where ':args' is mandatory.
2. Avoid mouse and arrow keys.
3. Prefer motions and text objects over repeated manual cursor movement.

## Speed Drill (Advanced, 5 min)
1. Repeat the same task 3 rounds.
2. Track time and error count each round.
3. Beat previous time without increasing errors.
